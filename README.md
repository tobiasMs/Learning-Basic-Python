2. Understanding transformation of number, character, and string
3. Knowing how to replace elements in string and how to check the string
4. Understanding  string formatting and operations on list, set, and string
5. Knowing the operator, operand, and expression in the Python
6. Knowing more about conditional expression
# Benefits :
